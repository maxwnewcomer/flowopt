## flowopt
#### by Max Newcomer (2023)

**flowopt** is a hyperparameter optimization and tuning system for steady-state and transient models ran by MODFLOW-NWT. **flowopt** is also proud to be written in Rust (so it's *blazingly fast*).

#### Associated Publications

**flowopt** is based off the research done in the following paper:
